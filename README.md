# rimgo
An alternative frontend for Imgur. Based on [rimgu](https://codeberg.org/3np/rimgu) and rewritten in Go.

  <img alt="License: AGPLv3+" src="https://shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3+-blue.svg">
</a>

It's read-only and works without JavaScript. Images and albums can be viewed without wasting resources from downloading and running tracking scripts. No sign-up nags.

## Features

- [x] URL-compatible with i.imgur.com - just replace the domain in the URL
- [x] Images and videos (gifv, mp4) returned directly
- [ ] Galleries with comments
- [x] Albums
- [ ] User page
- [ ] Tag page

This is currently very early stage software. Some things left to implement (contributions welcome!):

- [x] Streaming (currently media is downloaded in full in rimgu before it's returned)
- [ ] Localization/internationalization
- [x] Pretty CSS styling (responsive?)
- [ ] Support for other popular image sites than only imgur
- [ ] Filtering and exploration on user/tags pages
- [ ] Responsive scaling of videos on user/tags pages
- [x] Logo

Things that are considered out of scope:

* Uploading/commenting/voting/etc - rimgu is read-only for now.
* Authentication, serving HTTPS, rate limiting, etc - Use a reverse proxy or load balancer like Caddy, Traefik, or NGINX.
* Anything requiring client-side JS or client-side directly interacting with upstream servers
